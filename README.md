NZBSplitter
===========

Perl script to split up large NZB files into individual NZB's. This can be used to split up large NZB's which contain multiple "posts" into individual NZB's per post such that the newsreader can process them accordingly.
Reads all.nzb from the working directory and outputs splitted NZB's into the working directory with the names of the individual posts.
